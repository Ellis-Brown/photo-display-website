# Ideas
1. Select and compare mode
    - In select and compare mode, you can select images from the main path, (option to select all), then they will have the ability to compare them.
    - Move left, right, drop from list, download, select more, drop all, numbers to compare, left and right to compare. A little UI will show all image previews, and you will scroll left and right, etc.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
